      <description>Samuel Granjeaud is a research engineer in computational biology at Inserm. He is working at CRCM&amp;rsquo;s Integrative BioInformatics facility. CIBI is carrying out various omics analyses for experiments of CRCM&amp;rsquo;s teams, such as NGS technologies (mutations, ChIPseq, RNAseq), proteomics and metabolomics, cytometry, single cell RNAseq&amp;hellip; While these technologies generate massive amounts of data on cell behaviour and functioning, interpreting these data and making them readily comprehensible is a current challenge. CIBI is applying state-of-the-art pipelines and data mining techniques to address specific questions in biology and clinics concerning cancerology and immunotherapy.</description>
